# patternfly-webcomponents

PatternFly design Web Components using Sass from [@patternfly/patternfly](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly).

This repo is currently being used for testing: **_NO COMPONENTS ARE PRODUCTION READY_**

## Getting started
1. Clone submodules
```sh
git submodule update --init
```
2. Install dependencies using yarn workspaces:
```sh
yarn install
```
3. Start our custom watch + es-dev-server script. Open http://localhost:9000/docs/index.html
```sh
yarn start
```
OR

4. Start our React Storybook
```sh
yarn storybook
```

## Creating a new component
I've written a custom scaffolding tool.
```sh
yarn generate componentName
```
